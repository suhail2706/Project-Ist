            <h1>Amar Singh College Srinagar</h1>
            <p>It was established in November 1913 as Amar Singh Technical Institute, to teach willing students art, <br>
                culture, and basics like masonry and carpentry. It was formally opened on 29 May 1914 by Maharaja Pratap Singh. <br>
                In June 1942, the Technical Institute was converted into Amar Singh College through bifurcation of Sri Pratap College <br>
                 commemorating the name of the father of Hari Singh, the then Maharaja of Kashmir. The College was recognized by <br>
                 University Grants Commission of India (UGC) in June 1972. The College is accredited by National Assessment and <br>
                  Accreditation Council [NAAC] with B++ Grade.<br><br>
